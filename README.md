# Blue

Building off my learnings with [Red](https://github.com/rayhanadev/red). This
is a open-source multiplayer code editor that allows you to write and run
code in real-time with others.

Built to allow distributed learning and collaboration at workshops for
[Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com).
